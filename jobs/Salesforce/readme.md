# Mews Salesforce developer task

The task is to implement an ExchangeRateProvider for Czech National Bank. Find data source on their web - part of the task is to find the source of the exchange rate data and a way how to extract it from there.

The solution has to be buildable, runnable and the program should output the obtained exchange rates.

The goal is to implement all Exchange rates from and to Czech Koruna in a table format so that your end user is always aware of the latest exchange rates (updated once per day).

To submit your solution, just open a new pull request to this repository.

Please write the code like you would if you needed this to run on production environment and had to take care of it long-term.
