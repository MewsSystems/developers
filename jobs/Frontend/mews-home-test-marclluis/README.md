# Movie Search App

This is my Movie search application built with React and Redux for Mews. It allows users to search for movies, view movie details, and scroll through search results. The app uses the [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) as mentioned in the instructions to fetch movie data.

## Features

- Search for movies by title
- View movie details
- Infinite scroll to load more search results
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Handles the back functionality to resume your search where you left
- Controls the 404 page error

## Technologies Used

- React
- Redux
- React Router
- Material-UI
- Jest
