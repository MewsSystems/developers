# Movie Search

Frontend Challenge - React client that consumes an API and can list and detail
movies.

### DEMO

To see the website running go to:
[Movie Search App](https://peaceful-palmier-221e1d.netlify.app/)

## IMPORTANT

- I could use `redux` to manage the app state, but it is a small app soo I
  didn't want to overengineer.

This is a project made in:

- `React` with `Typescript`.
- `Material UI` and `styled-components` for styling.

I set it up without the use of "create-react-app".

environment.
