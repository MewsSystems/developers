# Mews frontend developer task

You should start with creating a fork of the repository. When you're finished with the task, you should create a pull request.

Your task will be to create a simple movie search application. The application will have 2 views - search and movie detail. The search view is the default view, and should contain search input and display paginated list of found movies with a way to load additional batch. Search should start automatically after typing into the input is finished - there is no need for a search button. Clicking on a movie gets you to the movie detail view where detailed information about the movie should be listed. 

To retrieve information about movies, use [TheMovieDb API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). You can use our api key to authorize requests:

## Required technologies

To test your proficiency with technologies we use the most, we require the solution to be written with use of TypeScript, React, Redux and styled-components. Use of any additional libraries is allowed and it's up to you.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Running the project (by create-react-app)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
