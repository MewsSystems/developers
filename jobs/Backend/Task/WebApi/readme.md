# ExchangeRateUpdater with clean architecture

Simple and extendable Web API project design with clean architecture principles in mind.

There is also a console project with the original output.

## Notes
- The solution is too complicated for such a small task. I was designing it with anticipation of adding many new features in the future.
- I didn't spend much time on mappings and web api error handling (see TODOs in code)
- I didn't spend any time on writing tests but I would never skip them for a real application.
