# How To Run

1. In Order to run it you need to have the main host running. Make sure the address and port are correctly set in settings.yaml.
2. Usually we would create a client sdk that handles resiliency and does RPC calls. We would also set up a docker container before running the acceptance tests against it. 
I just wanted to make it easier to run for this assignment. :)
