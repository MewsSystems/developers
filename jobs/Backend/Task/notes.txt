1. The api contract was implemented with a method to call it assuming it was going to get used from multiple services using the same technology(DOTNET). 
	This would simplify authentication, exception handling etc.

2. Limited unit test coverage implemented due to time constraints

3. Simplest authentication would use JwtTokens in which case there would be a need for a separate method in the api for logging in

4. In a live app:
	- Logging would be done to an Azure Insights sink with request correlation, logging levels etc.
	- CORS would have to be configured for calls to external APIs
	- Secrets like API keys would be stored in a high security place such as Azure Key Vault
