# Exchange Rate Provider

Program to fetch exchange rates from Czech National Bank (CNB) and lists only _selected_ ones.

All listed exchange rates are in relation to the Czech crown (CZK).

**<abbr title="Nota bene">NB!</abbr>** There are few comments in code which start with light bulb emoji (ðŸ’¡). These comments are not meant
to be part of the code, but rather to explain some of the decisions made during the development.

## Prerequisites

- [net8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- connection to [the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDbyYGrswtg)

## Execute

Before running the program, edit [`Program.cs`](ExchangeRateUpdater/Program.cs) and set the `Program.Currencies`
variable to the currencies you want to list.

```bash
dotnet run --project ExchangeRateUpdater
```

## Test

It is possible to run unit tests and/or integration tests separately or all together.

```bash
dotnet test --filter Category=Unit
```
```bash
dotnet test --filter Category=Integration
````
```bash
dotnet test
```

## Benchmarks

Project contains few benchmarks (namely to compare algorithms of selecting currencies by [`ExchangeRateTransformer`](ExchangeRateUpdater/ExchangeRateProvider.cs).
To run *all* benchmarks, use following command (if executing from IDE, make sure you switch to `Release` configuration):

```bash
dotnet run -c Release --project ExchangeRateUpdater.Benchmarks -- --filter *
```
