# Mews backend developer task (Ruby on Rails)

The task is to implement an [ExchangeRateProvider](Task/ExchangeRateProvider.cs) for Czech National Bank. The linked example is written in .NET, but it serves only as a reference. Find the data source on their web - part of the task is to find the source of the exchange rate data and a way how to extract it from there.

It is up to you to decide which Ruby gems to use and whether to implement it as a Rails application. Any code design changes/decisions to the provided skeleton are also completely up to you.

The application should expose a simple REST API (ideally JSON). Adding some UI (e.g. via server-rendered pages or a SPA) is a benefit for full-stack applications.

The solution has to be buildable, runnable and the test program should output the obtained exchange rates.

Goal is to implement a fully functional provider based on real world public data source of the assigned bank.

To submit your solution, just open a new pull request to this repository. Alternatively, you can share your repo with Mews interviewers.

Please write the code like you would if you needed this to run on production environment and had to take care of it long-term.
