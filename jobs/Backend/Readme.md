# Mews backend developer task - David Rimar

This is a .NET API project allowing clients to query a list of exchange rates with the Czech Korona as the target currency.

### Notes:
- Completely aware that most of the unit tests are missing
- Because the CNB API is public, no authentication takes place between the ExchangeRateUpdater API and the CNB API
- Debatable why I went for an API style project, thought it would be more realistic
- Because it is an API endpoint to get exchange rates, there is Fluent Validation on the supplied currencies

### Discussion Points:
**Extendibility**: Allow the client to specify a base currency beside the list of currencies, enabling the extension to call
						other bank's APIs to fetch exchange rates based on the requested base currency. How could this be done?
- CnbExchangeRateProvider class?
- How do we do a switch based on the base currency?

**API Design**: Because this turned out to be an API, the GET exchange rates endpoint expects a list of currencues as query parameters. It raises a question how long an URI can be..

**API Authentication**: Implement authentication between APIs in production environment

**Storing Configs**: Currenctly in appsettings.json but normally it would come from Azure Table Storage for example.

**Exception Handling**: If the call to the CNB API yields an exception, the application throws an exception. 
						As it is an API, we probably don't want the client to just see a 500. Shoud we return a NotFound from the API instead?
