# Reservation Management

**Fullstack App**

> [!NOTE]
> This task will involve a separate repository.

Start by forking [the mews-reservations-int repo](https://github.com/snewell92/mews-reservations-int/tree/main) and
following the "Running the App" portion of the readme.

You will be acting as if you are the lead engineer on a team, executing tasks from the `/backlog`. You are free to pick up
any tasks you can reasonably do in ~90 minutes. You must indicate which tasks are complete and which are partially complete.

Contribute as if you were intending to own and operate this product to serve customers on an ongoing basis on
a **growing team**, in a fast paced scale up.

Your submission must be in one Pull Request from a fork, and we encourage you to organize your commits so reviewers can
step through commit by commit.

<summary>Technology</summary>

The given technologies chosen for the starting point (.NET + React+TS) are what the majority of code at Mews is written in.

You have **complete autonomy** for this product as a Lead Engineer and can implement any technology decisions you see fit for
the tasks at hand. This includes adding / removing libraries, and adopting any design or architectural patterns.
If you want, you could even _swap the stacks_ and start over with a different pair of stacks, or a full stack solution.
You will need to **collaborate with the stakeholders (aka interviewers)** on all decisions during review (aka the interview).
