Contribute as if you were intending to own and operate this product to serve customers on an ongoing basis on
a **growing team**, in a fast paced scale up.

Your submission must be in one Pull Request from a fork. Organize your commits so reviewers can

## Slack

As part of our test process, we will be sending you an invite to join our Slack channel.
This will allow you to communicate with our team if you have any questions or need support during the task.

Please keep an eye on your inbox, as sometimes Slack invites can end up in the “Other” or “Junk” folder.
If you encounter any issues connecting, don’t hesitate to reach out to your recruiter for assistance.
