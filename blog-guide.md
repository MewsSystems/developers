First off - why should you want to write a blog post?
=====================================================

Good question, right? While writing a blog post can seem daunting at first, you'll be surprised by how rewarding it can be. Blog posts provide a way for you to:

-   Share your knowledge and insights and connect with your broader community
-   Help, motivate, and even inspire others through a topic that you're passionate about
-   Build value for yourself and your company
-   Find new pathways for personal and professional growth

So, are you ready to find out how to write a good blog post?

Have a clear workflow
=====================

Before we start, let's break down the blog writing process into smaller steps. Doing this helps turn the seemingly impossible into something entirely manageable, and dare I say, fun!? 

The main stages are as follows: **prewriting → drafting → revising → editing → publishing**

Within each of these stages, there are steps you can take to help streamline the process. 

Following a familiar, repeatable process helps you establish good practices and a strong foundation on which to build your post. As the saying goes, *work smarter, not harder*.

-   **Plan your content:** Draw up a clearly defined brief for your post 
-   **Build a basic structure:** Make notes of what you'll include where, with SEO in mind
-   **Find your hook:** Know how to draw your readers in and keep them hooked on the page
-   **Pen your 1st draft:** Get some words on the page, you'll figure out the rest later!
-   **Revise and edit:** Read, re-read, revise, edit, and edit some more

The following sections will deep dive into each of these stages, helping you become a blog post writing extraordinaire in no time!

Just keep in mind that this multi-stage process typically takes more than just a few hours or days, even for the most skilled of writers. Work at your own pace and leave enough time for preparing and writing your post in a way that's both effective and comfortable for you.

Create a clear plan
===================

Before you start writing your post, you want to spend a good chunk of time planning. This is one of the most crucial parts of the process, as it sets the stage for the rest of your post. 

Questions to ask yourself:
--------------------------

-   What conversations in my field can I be a part of or start?
-   Does the topic interest me? (Nothing kills a blog post more than an unenthusiastic author!)
-   What's the main message I want to get across?
-   Is it something my target audience will find interesting or useful?
-   What do I want my readers to take away from the post? How will I make that happen? 

When you have the answers to these questions, it's time to do some research. Find out what's already out there when it comes to your topic. Has someone written an almost identical post? If so, you might want to build on it or tackle it from a different angle. This also presents an opportunity for you to learn from others who are addressing similar topics - that's the personal growth we talked about.

With your topic decided, you can then establish the specific goals/point of view of your post and start collecting relevant information. The next part involves formulating these ideas into a clearer picture.

Build a solid outline (and don't forget about SEO)
==================================================

Once you've done your research and know what your message and key points will be, it's time to start building a structure for your blog post and organising it into a logical fashion.

Having a plan and frame for your post helps you save time down the line because you've already done your homework and have the bare bones of your post drawn up, keeping you in order and on track!

Your outline should take on an order similar to the following:

-   Blog post title
-   Introduction
    -   Body
    -   Main Point 1
    -   Main Point 2
    -   Main Point 3
-   Conclusion

*Additional research and recommended reading*

Now let's take a look at each of these sections in more detail.

Your **headline** should:
-------------------------

-   Spark your readers' curiosity and make them want to know more
-   Convey the intent of your post without giving away the secret (what are you promising?)
-   Be informative but short and sweet (to avoid getting cut off in search engines)
-   You can check the quality of your title with a [headline analyzer](https://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer).

*Important note*

While some people like to come up with their heading at the start, for others, it can be a huge source of writers' block. Do what works best for you! Writing your headline at the end can help you have a clearer picture of exactly what your blog post truly conveys - so don't worry if you don't have it from the get-go.

Your **introduction** should:
-----------------------------

-   Grab your readers' attention and stir up more focused interest
-   Let them know what you're going to talk about, and why (thesis statement)
-   Identify what they'll take away from the post (e.g. pinpointing a problem your readers face and offering a solution)

Your **body** should:
---------------------

-   Clearly share your knowledge and insights and how they relate to your primary message
-   Divide your content into focused points with supporting evidence for each (including your own knowledge/experience and relevant information/facts)
-   Present information in an attractive and easily digestible format (where possible, illustrate your points with images, infographics, code snippets, bullet points, numbered lists, etc.)

Your **conclusion** should:
---------------------------

-   Summarise the main points of your post and neatly tie them together
-   Restate your resolution and share any closing thoughts you might have
-   Encourage your readers to take further action or reading (this is what we call a CTA)
-   End on an engaging note -  keep it interesting from the very first to the very last word!

Now, how do we want to format all this so that it both attracts your reader to the max while at the same time optimising for SEO? Easy, the main thing you have to do here is:

Break up the page (make your post scannable)
--------------------------------------------

Besides engaging writing, providing a good user experience is one of the best things you can do for your blog post. Not only does this keep your reader interested, but it's also a great way to make your text SEO friendly. How can you make this happen? 

By breaking up the page, that's how! This makes your post more readable, attractive, and welcoming, as well as leaves empty spaces so your readers' eyes can take a rest. Some ways to do this, you ask?

-   **Subheadings** above each of your main points to guide your readers and let them know what to expect in each section. This way, they can conveniently scan the page for information. *These also make it easier for you to write your post by breaking it into bite-sized sections.*
-   **Short paragraphs**, which are more inviting than big blocks of text - include suitable [transitional phrases](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/transition-words-phrases/) between each paragraph to further guide your readers.
-   Bullet points, quotes, infographics, code snippets, etc. to make your post more digestible.
-   The right **images** help break up the page while making your post more vibrant and memorable.

Level up your SEO 
------------------

Besides formatting, here are some other easy ways you can make your post more SEO friendly:

-   Ensure your topic adds value (is it something people are interested in reading about?)
-   Research trending keywords related to your topic
-   Include some of these keywords naturally within your writing to increase visibility
-   Link to internal/external content to strike a chord with readers and build valuable associations
-   Optimise your headline and post length. While there's no one size fits all solution for this, you can follow these general rules:
    -   *Keep your blog title under 65 characters (8-12 words)*
    -   *Your post should contain at least 300 words but ideally over 1000 to rank well in search engines*

However, don't feel pressured to lengthen your post just for the sake of SEO - your main goal should be to provide relevant, valuable information to your target readers.

Hook your reader and keep them reading till the end!
====================================================

When putting your blog post together, you want to make sure you have a strong hook. Something that will peak your reader's curiosity and make them want to know more. While your title and introduction are a start, you want to keep your momentum going till the end. What are some ways you can connect with your reader and draw them wholeheartedly into your journey?

-   **Create a captivating headline**: This is the first thing your readers will see, so make it enticing!
-   **Make it easy on the eyes**: If your post is welcoming and easy to read, it's more likely to keep your audience's attention (remember our nifty formatting rules).
-   **Use clear/plain language**: Overcomplicating things can scare away readers (and you certainly don't want that!) so try to keep your writing straightforward, friendly, and informal.
-   **Keep it conversational**: Think of your post as a conversation between you and your audience. Use it as a way to explain your connection to the topic and open broader discussions.
-   **Build trust and credibility**: You can do this by adding stats or relevant links to further reading.

It's also a good idea to think about how you can use this time to foster a sense of community and open wider conversations. To build a connection and strong network with your readers, try your best to:

-   Keep it real, be yourself, and genuinely engage with your audience
-   Think about your readers and what they can learn from your experience
-   Answer questions they want solved and provide meaningful directions for the future
-   Propose solutions and offer actionable recommendations
-   Allow comments on your posts to build a stronger relationship with your readers. You can even spark conversation by asking them for their own experiences with your topic.

Pen your first draft: and don't sweat the small stuff, yet
==========================================================

First, jot down notes in your outline so that you know what you're going to talk about where - you can expand on them later. This will keep you organised and save you a lot of editing time down the line!

When writing your 1st draft, don't worry too much about getting it perfect the first time round. Just get all your thoughts out on paper - you'll have plenty of time to revise and edit it later on. 

Take a line of advice from the author Jodi Picault, who once wisely said:

> *"You can always edit a bad page. You can't edit a blank page."*

So, try to let go of any initial writer's block and start typing away. You'll find your way eventually.

*Note:* You can write your first draft gradually, or all in one go, whatever works best for you

Three step revision: turn a good first draft into a great one
=============================================================

Part I - self revision
----------------------

Once you have your first draft written, take a break then come back to it with fresh eyes. This can bring newfound clarity and objectivity, helping you see your writing from a new perspective.

Some things to think about when re-reading your post:

-   Is the primary message of your post clear and succinct?
-   Do your subheadings align with your key points?
-   Do these key points logically flow from one to the next?
-   Is anything overcomplicated? Can it be made easier to understand? 
-   Is there any repetition or unnecessary information? Don't be afraid to cut it out!
-   Does your post follow our formatting rules - is it scannable?
-   Is the flow and tone what you were going for? (Reading it out loud can help)
-   And of course, are there any word choice, spelling, or grammatical mistakes? ([Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)). You might also want to check your fluency and style with the handy [Hemingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/)

Read through your post carefully with these questions in mind, making amendments where necessary. Make sure your post is both easily understandable, purposeful, and appealing to your reader, and that every aspect of your writing adds to the overall message you're trying to convey.

Remember: *quality over quantity*. So don't be afraid to make big changes - after all, it is just your first draft!

Part II - peer revision
-----------------------

Now it's time to have a peer or colleague go over your post. Someone who understands your topic can provide meaningful feedback, check for ambiguity, and ensure your writing achieves its desired intent. This will help you fine tune your writing and make any essential content or structural changes.

Part III - professional revision
--------------------------------

The final step is having a professional revise and edit your post. Let them know any lingering questions you might have and direct them towards your specific goals. This will help you put the final touches on your post and make sure your piece is ready to go live.

Congratulations, now it's time to hit publish!
==============================================

You've put in all the hard work, and now it's ready to be shared with your audience. Pat yourself on the back, you deserve it!

**Don't forget to share your content with the world!!!**

Make sure to share and promote your blog on LinkedIn, Twitter, or other social media platforms so you can reach a wider audience, and so that your peers and followers can get to know what you've been up to and have a chance to connect with you. If you feel insecure about sharing it yourself, the Community team or your manager will be happy to share it for you.

*One final thing to remember*: don't get too caught up in how many people read your post - it may be a niche topic that will have its own set of readers who value it.

Now you should be all set to start your next post with confidence. 💪
