# Mews Photos - Android Test

- All necessities except landscape orientation (and thus device rotation) should be implemented.
- Please consider this more of a  tech demo. I had limited personal time space and did not want to delay this further in order to get nicer UI.
- Recycler doesn't exactly expand, but has onLongClickListener implemented to show more information about an item.
- It was nice to practice Kotlin. I'm starting to like the language!
