# Notes by developer (Denis)

I felt the urge to mention a few things worth mentioning.

* I omitted tests! For the sake of example I refused to tinker with Jest in order to conserve time.
* I updated the dev stack to some of the latest technologies.
* I rewrote quite a bit of the Skeleton provided (see commit list)
* I would CSS a bit differently in a production project. I'd take more time to make it modular - introduce variables and write it in JavaScript. Really - I believe in CSS-in-JS if done properly.
* I did not use Flow. And I still haven't tried TypeScript (07/2017)
* I did not prefix css. Is it really necessary in this showcase?
* That said, it's all only supposed to be working on Chrome.
* I did not differentiate between dev and prod webpack config :)
* I did not use any css frameworks and no grid. Useless with project this small.
