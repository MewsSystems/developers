# Readme

The task is to implement [ExchangeRateProvider]( https://github.com/MewsSystems/samples/blob/master/ExchangeRateUpdater/ExchangeRateProvider.cs) for a bank that you have been assigned. It is up to you to decide which technology (from .NET FW) or package to use. Part of the task is to find the source of the exchange rate data and a way how to extract it from there.

The solution has to be buildable, runnable and the test program should output the exchange rates obtained at the run time. Please submit the solution in form of a pull request to this repository.
